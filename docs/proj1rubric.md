# Project 1 Rubric

|What | Notes|evidence|score 0..4<br>(0=no, 2=ok, 4=wow!)|
|-----|------|------|--------|
| |workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|evidence  in GH||
|| Number of commits|in GH||
|| Number of commits: by different people|in GH||
|| Issues reports: there are **many**|||
||  issues are being  closed|evidence in GH||
|| DOI badge: exists |in GH||
||Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |in GH||
||Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |||
||Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries||
||Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|||
||Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|||
|Tools Matter| Use of version control tools|||
||Use of  style checkers |config files in GH showing your config||
|| Use of code  formatters. |config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config||
|| Use of syntax checkers. |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  ||
|| Use of code coverage |config files in GH||
|| other automated analysis tools|config files in GH||
|| test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base||
|| test cases are routinely executed|e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something||
| | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|||
|| issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here||
|| Chat channel: exists|||
|| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it||
| zero internal boundaries | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|||
| | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|||
| | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|||
| | evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|||
|short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|||
