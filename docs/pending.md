seee section 5.2
Our data did not reveal a strong connection between continuation intentions in general and actual continuation behavior in the form of continued GitHub activity after a hackathon (H7). We did however find the intention of teams to expand their user base, acquire funding or create a startup (code 2c) to be positively associated to longer-term continuation activity while technical continuation intentions such as finishing the technical development of a teamâ€™s project as it was intended during the hackathon or adding new features was not connected to continuation activity.
