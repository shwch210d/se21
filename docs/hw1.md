# Homework 1: Task Training (Due Tuesday, Aug. 26th)
  This document contains detailed descriptions on assignment 1. The purpose of this homework is to introduce the reuse in software engineering.

## Before You Start... Be Familiar with Reuse 
  Before you start your first assignment, please make sure you have already understand what is reuse, and the reuse type . https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md contains the detailed description on the types of reuse, as well as some tips on identifying reuse.
  
## Working Steps...
  - Step 1: Please direct to the following link: https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/training.md
  - Step 2: Read the training material.
  - Step 3: Skim the four papers listed in that training document.
    **(Warning: It may cost you one hour to skim the first paper since it's your first time to do this task. The skimming time of subsequent papers will reduce to 15-20 minutes after you got familiar with this task)**
  - Step 4: Record the reuse you identified in a .csv file with following format:
    | gh_id |  paper_doi  | reuse_type |       comment      | citation_number |  reused_doi  | alt_url | page_num |
    |-------|-------------|------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------|----------|
    | xxxxx | https://... |   method   | replication of ... |        [1]      |  https://... |         |    150   |

## Submission...
  Please submit your result .csv file to Moodle with following file name: **[First Name]-[Last Name]_HW1.csv** (e.g. Xiao-Ling_HW1.csv)
  
## Final Step...
  Now you can compare your results with the true labels: https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/results-sample.csv . After the comparison, please think about the missing or extra entries you made, and be ready for the future assignments.
  
  Please notice that the correctness will not affect your assignment score. This assignment is just for training purpose. So don't copy paste the correct entries into your result sheet.
