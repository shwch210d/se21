# Project 1

Goal: start something that another groups will say
"yes, for Project2, we want to finish that".

By the end of September, project1 will  deliver:

- something that executes **some** of your goals, 
- a [roadmap](https://github.com/se20z09/units_converter_extension/projects/1) telling others
  **where to go from here**
- all the "bling" (described below) needed to convince another group that they should use your system.

## Start by Picking  a Project

(Hint: do it now!)

Pick something. Code it in any language using any tools you like. But

- everyone on the team has to use the same tools
- all the work has to be shared via Github (public repos, 
  general GH-- not NCSU):

Pick something that  was 
[popular last year](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mnNlF0Gx6E5oppd7LpeYy_mNuUkhgh30PiC2Z3RrGXI/edit#gid=0)
(look for the things that got most votes).

- Heck, even get a kick start by starting  with a project from last year.

What to do? Well pick something:

- Cool: 
  - Cause you have to impress;
- Not ambitious:
  - So you can make significant progress in 4 weeks;
- Not too small: 
  - So you can  impress people with the work;
- Small enough:
  - So you can finish;
- Where there is something already running:
  - So you get going fast;
- Something the whole team can contribute to
  - Work in  a language that everyone in the team can handle:
  - Work on a problem everyone can understand

If you want to be in the running for "projects
that survivie into the next round"
your system has to do something better then something else.

- Which means your code has to address some problem in some current system
- And do so in a manner that is quantifiable.

## Grading

Your work will be assessed via how many of the 
<a href="https://go.pardot.com/l/6342/2017-10-24/3xr3f2/6342/188781/Publication_LinuxKernelReport_2017.pdf">Linux Kernel Best Practices</a>
 (see pages 25,26)
you can emulate.

- Reflect on our [project1 grading rubric](proj1rubric.md)
- Write a 2 page pdf on the commnection between the items in that rubric and the Linux Kernel best practices.
  And that document to your repo as docs/proj1rubricComments.pdf. Write the that pdf using
  [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty)
  - Not "nearly" this template. This tempalte. Learn Latex. Hit: use [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
- Copy the rubric to a markdown file. Fill it in. Where needed, add links into your repo to justify your answers.
  And that document to your repo as docs/proj1rubric.md.

## Good practices for Effecive Teaming



|What | Notes|
|-----|------|
|Location| Meet however it makes teams most comfortable (in-person, on-line, whatever the team agrees on).|
|Duration| Usually, keep meetings short (exception: long range direction meetings) |
|End of meeting | Always agree on next meeting time before this meeting ends.|
|| Review everyone's to do list|
|Start of meeting | review everyone's to do lists from last meeting|
|Misc | Group members attended group sessions|
|Distrbuted dev model: | decisions made by unanmyous vote|
|| group meetings had a round robin speaking order|
|| group meetings had a moderator that managed the round robin| 
|| group meeting moderator rotated among  the group|
