# Homework 2: Practice on a real packet (Due Thursday, Sept.2nd)


Following the previous assignment, in this one we will:
  
- Read some most recent cutting-edge papers in the SE community
- Find reused works in those papers
- Submit the reuse report in the required format just like in HW 1

## What to do
Go to the DOR [repository](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/issues).
  
Find the packet number (wp-XX) you want to work on. You must choose a packet that have **NOT** been assigned to anyone yet.
  
Assign yourself to the issue following the [standard instruction](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md).
  
Grab your packet from the [DOR project](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/tree/main/workflow/todo) 
  
Find and report reuse.
  
## What to submit

Prepare your DOR report in the required format (see the [sample csv](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/results-sample.csv))

Name your report csv file **wp-XX-results.csv** (where XX refers to the work package id like "ae").
  
Upload you report file following the [standard instruction](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md).

In the central spreadsheet XXX, paste the link to the issue your worked on (under the column `link to result`).
