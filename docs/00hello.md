# History


Once upon a time:

-  "users" were considered to be outside of the scope of SE. 
     - “The notion of user cannot be precisely defined  and therefore has no place in CS or SE” -- Dijkstra, ICSE4, 79
     - And then ...
- "compiling" was considered not safe practice for programmers 
     - See "cleanrooms" and Harlan Mills, 1985. 
     - And then ...
- "requirements" was not an SE prolem.
     - "Analysis and allocation of the system requirements is NOT the responsibility of the SE group but is a prerequisite for their work”. -- Paulk, 1993
     - And then ...
-  "testing" was seen as "someone else's problem" (the test team). And then ...
-  "operations" was seen as "someone else's problem" (the field engineers and the maintaince team). And then ...
-  "AI" was seen as separate to SE. And then ...


See other trends, below:

- Warning the following timeline might be wrong 
&plusmn; 5 years.
- Also if some trend is  big  in one decade,
  - then you know that was the result
of years of prior engineering.


## 1950s: Working it out from  Scratch

 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005IEGK5C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">Turing's Cathederal</a>

- Computers and atomic bombs were invented at the same time, by the same people, for the same reasons.
- We live today inside their hastily (but brilliantly) conceived design assumptions.

## 1960s: Scaling Up Process


1960: The mother of all abstractions (warning: amazing): [about](http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html) :: [in python](https://norvig.com/lispy.html)

-  "As computers have grown more powerful, 
   the new languages being developed have been moving steadily toward the 'Lisp' model. 
   A popular recipe for new programming languages in the past 20 years has been to take the 'C'; model of computing and add to it, piecemeal, 
   parts taken from the 'Lisp' model, like runtime typing and garbage collection."   
   -- Paul Graham

1968: The Mother of All Demos (warning: long) [about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos) :: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6rKUf9DWRI)

"For some years I have been successfully 
using the following rule of thumb for 
scheduling a software task:

- l/3 planning
- l/6 coding
- l/4 component test and early system test 
-  l/4 system test, all components in hand."

Pay attention: half of development is testing.

## 1970s: Personnel

Alan Kay: the best way to predict the future is to invent it.

- If you want to see what he meant: [Microelectronics and the Personal Computer](http://mnielsen.github.io/notes/kay/micro.pdf) Alan C. Kay Scientific
American Vol. 237, No. 3 (September 1977), pp. 230-245

"The user makes his primary input through a typewriter like keyboard
and a pointing device called a mouse which controls the position
of an arrow on the screen."

"WINDOWS" display frames within the  larger display screen, enabling
the user to organize  and  edit information at several levels  of
refinement.

## 1990s: Connections (Welcome to the Internet)

- Internet, 
- Open Source; e.g. see 
  [Shares of Linux Firm Red Hat More Than Triple After IPO](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB934376738897331391)
- [Internet Bubble](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/dotcom-bubble/):
  1995 to 2001, massive price rises in Internet  stocks. Then...
  - "The bursting of the bubble caused market panic through massive 
      sell-offs of dotcom company stocks, driving their values further down, 
    and by 2002, investor losses were estimated at around $5 trillion."

## 2010: Mobile

Welcome to the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy).

The age is (myth)misinformation. Information, weaponized.

## 2020: AI

AI 

Autonomous vehicles.

?? Blockchain

- Ezra Klein, NY Times,  Aug 12, 2021:
  - If the original internet let you easily copy information, 
    the next internet will let you easily trade ownership of digital goods. 
  - Crypto lets you make digital goods scarce, which increases their value; 
    it lets you prove ownership, which allows you to buy and sell them; 
    and it makes digital identities verifiable, as that’s merely information you own
  - Together, they unlock the potential for a true economy for digital goods, 
    where creators actually get rewarded for what they make. I will admit to some skepticism that this is how it’ll play out, as many of the financiers funding crypto also founded and sit on the boards of the companies that set the terms of today’s internet, but we’ll see.
